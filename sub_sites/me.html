                    <p>My name is NAME and I am a junior Full-Ftack Developer from Poland.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <p>My dreams about becoming a programmer started when I was
                    10 years old and since then I had put a lot of work into achiving this goal.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <p>I always thought of writing code as the way to create practicly anything I would want
                    giving me a huge amount of freedom in creation.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <p>I feel good spending time near other people but I also love some quality time between me and my code.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <p>Whenever I find myself within a group of people I like to take a role of the leader but I dont mind if someone more expirienced in that specific field does it for me.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <p>I think of myself as a really patient and empathetic person, with a gift of motivating and teaching others, leading them to great results.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <p>I am also a hardworker and I like challenges, always giving the problem everything within me.</p>
